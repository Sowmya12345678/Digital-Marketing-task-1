### 4. Manage Reviews & Respond (Negative or Positive)

* Monitor reviews from platforms (Google, Trustpilot, Yelp, industryâ€‘specific). ([upcity.com][11])
* For **negative reviews**:

  * Respond **within 24â€“48 hours** with empathy.
  * Acknowledge the issue, apologize, propose a solution or private followâ€‘up.
  * Offer to resolve offline and follow up later (sometimes reviewer updates the review). ([Papirfly][5], [cision.com][1], [Warrior PR][12])
  * Use templates for efficiency, but personalize each reply. ([Papirfly][5])
* For **positive reviews**:

  * Thank the customer publicly.
  * Encourage sharing or featuring it in your content or web/social posts.

### 5. Promote Positive Sentiment

* Encourage **happy customers to leave reviews**: email reminders, QR codes, postâ€‘interaction requests. ([42signals.com][13])
* Feature **customer testimonials and userâ€‘generated content (UGC)** in marketing: case studies, quotes, social media reposts. ([Wikipedia][14])
* Publish **highâ€‘quality, helpful content** (blogs, guides, videos) to position your brand as expert and push positive SEO signals. ([42signals.com][13])

### 6. Ongoing Analysis & Improvement

* Regularly track KPIs:

  * Review volume and average rating
  * Sentiment trends over time
  * Share of voice vs competitors
  * Recurring feedback themes or complaints. ([Sprout Social][10], [sprinklr.com][9])
* Combine external review data and internal feedback (support tickets, surveys, NPS/CSAT metrics).
* Use analytics dashboards (e.g. Google Data Studio, Tableau) to report progress and refine strategy. ([Wikipedia][15])

### 7. Crisis & Influencer Risk Management

* Maintain an **influencer vetting process**: review history, values, content alignment before partnerships. ([Financial Times][16])
* Set up a **rapid response workflow** for negative campaigns or misinformation:

  * Monitor emerging issues
  * Draft public messaging templates
  * Assign crisis team standby to act in <â€¯1 hour. ([Papirfly][5], [Financial Times][16])
